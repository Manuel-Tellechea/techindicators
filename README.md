# techindicators
Python functions to calculate technical indicators from stock price data using Numpy.

## Purpose

These Python functions calculate various technical indicators from price time series data of stocks or other securities. The price data must be supplied as Numpy arrays and the functions rely on Numpy for calculations.  The code was written for those who would rather use Numpy matrices and arrays rather than Pandas dataframes for calculations.
